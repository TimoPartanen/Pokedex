Pokedex

Simple PHP&PostgreSQL example. I dont actually know much about Pokemon or its mechanics.

-------------
1. Use "createDatabaseScript.sql" to create database for your Pokedex.
2. Copy root directory "Pokedex" to your server/localhost (wamp, lamp etc.)

App should look about same as in Screenshots 1-4.
